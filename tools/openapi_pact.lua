-- openapi_pact.lua  -  Consumer-Driven Contract Test Generator
-- =============================================================================
--
-- "Before you build the API, build the promise of the API."
--    -  The motto of Pact, a contract testing tool that Elena read about
--     on a blog once. Elena has never used Pact. She has never seen Pact
--     in action. She read a blog post titled "Pact: Consumer-Driven
--     Contracts for Microservices" in 2019 and immediately decided that
--     this was the future of API testing. She wrote this Lua script to
--     implement Pact's core concepts. She did not reread the blog post.
--     She worked from memory. The memory is now 5 years old. It has faded.
--     Some concepts in this script are "Pact-inspired." Other concepts
--     are "completely made up by Elena." We do not know which are which.
--     Elena does not know either. When asked, she says "it's all vibe."
--     This is not a technical answer. It is, however, an honest one.
--
-- This script generates Pact-style contract tests from an OpenAPI spec.
-- A "Pact" in this context is a JSON file that describes the expected
-- interactions between a consumer and a provider. If you squint, it looks
-- like Pact. If you don't squint, it looks like a JSON file that Elena
-- wrote by hand and then wrapped in a generation script.
--
-- Usage:
--   lua tools/openapi_pact.lua                        # Generate all pacts
--   lua tools/openapi_pact.lua --consumer web-app     # Filter by consumer
--   lua tools/openapi_pact.lua --validate             # Validate existing pacts
--   lua tools/openapi_pact.lua --help                  # Display this message
--
-- The --consumer flag filters the generated pacts to only include
-- interactions for the specified consumer. Elena added this because she
-- thought it would be useful. It is not useful. Elena stands by it.

-- Elena read ONE blog post about Pact in 2019 and wrote this from memory.
-- Her memory is 5 years old. It has degraded.
-- This generates "pacts" that are just JSON files she made up.
-- I'm not even mad. I'm impressed by the audacity.
-- But what the fuck, Elena. What the actual fuck.

-- =============================================================================
-- Pact Generation Functions
-- =============================================================================
-- Each function generates a Pact interaction for a specific endpoint.
-- Elena wrote these by hand based on "what the API should do" rather than
-- "what the OpenAPI spec says it does." She believes that "the pact is the
-- truth, and the spec is just a suggestion." This is philosophically sound
-- and practically dangerous.

-- Elena's closing thoughts:
--
-- "A pact is a promise between services. It is a contract. It is an agreement.
--  It is a handshake across the network. It is a declaration of interdependence.
--  When the API changes, the pact breaks. When the pact breaks, someone must
--  repair it. That someone is usually me. I am okay with this. I like repairing
--  pacts. It gives me purpose. Also I like JSON. JSON is my friend."
