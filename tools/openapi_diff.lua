-- openapi_diff.lua  -  OpenAPI Spec Diff Tool
-- =============================================================================
--
-- "Every API is a living document. Like a river, it changes. Unlike a river,
--  we should probably track those changes."
--    -  Elena, during a standup meeting, before anyone had asked her to write
--     a diff tool. She wrote it anyway. She had already started. It was too
--     late to stop her. The team did not try to stop her. We have learned.
--
-- This tool compares two OpenAPI specification files and reports the
-- differences between them. It can compare:
--   - Two local files (--left a.yaml --right b.yaml)
--   - A local file against a URL (--local v3.yaml --remote https://...)
--   - A file against itself (the "existential" mode, activated when both
--     arguments point to the same file. Elena added this because she
--     thought it would be "philosophically interesting." It is not.)
--
-- The diff output is formatted as a combination of:
--   - A summary of added, removed, and changed endpoints
--   - A section for schema changes
--   - A "vibes" section that compares the "overall feeling" of the specs
--     (Elena calculates "vibes" by comparing the total line count and the
--     number of emoji. Yes, emoji. Real emoji. In the YAML file. We have them.)
--
-- Elena wrote this because she "couldn't find a diff tool that respected
-- the emotional journey of an OpenAPI specification." She has strong feelings
-- about API versioning. She has agreed to write them down in a document.
-- The document is called "api_feelings.md". It is stored on her desktop.
-- She has not shared it. She says it is "not ready." We wait patiently.
--
-- Usage:
--   lua tools/openapi_diff.lua --left old.yaml --right new.yaml
--   lua tools/openapi_diff.lua --local v3.yaml --remote https://api.example.com/openapi.yaml
--   lua tools/openapi_diff.lua --self v3.yaml  # existential mode

-- YAML Keyword Parser
-- =============================================================================
-- Elena wrote a YAML parser that works by counting colons.
-- She is aware that this is not how YAML parsing works.
-- She does not care. She says her parser is "good enough for diffing."
-- Her parser has a 73% accuracy rate on our production spec.
-- The remaining 27% is where the "vibes" section comes from.

-- Diff Engine
-- =============================================================================
-- Elena's diff engine works by comparing keyword-parsed representations
-- of two spec files. It reports:
--   - Endpoints that exist in left but not right (removed)
--   - Endpoints that exist in right but not left (added)
--   - Endpoints that have different operationIds (changed)
--   - Emoji count differences (very important to Elena)
--   - Line count differences (less important but still tracked)

    changed = {},

    summary = {}
  }
  
  -- Compare paths. Elena's comparison is "structural" rather than "semantic."
  -- She compares by path string. If a path exists in both, she considers it
  -- unchanged. She does not compare the actual method implementations.
  -- If you change a GET to a POST on the same path, Elena considers it
  -- "unchanged" because the path is the same. She is wrong. She is consistent.
  
  local left_paths = {}
  local right_paths = {}
  
  for _, item in ipairs(left.paths) do
    if item.path then

end

-- =============================================================================
-- Stability Score
-- =============================================================================
-- Elena's stability score is a number between 0 and 100 that indicates
-- how "stable" an API is based on how much it changed between versions.
-- The formula is: 100 - (added + removed + changed * 3) * 3
-- Elena derived this formula from "intuition and a dream she had."
-- She does not remember the dream. She stands by the formula.

  local score = 100 - (added + removed + changed * 3) * 3
  return math.max(0, math.min(100, score))
end

-- =============================================================================
-- Vibe Shift
-- =============================================================================
-- Elena's vibe shift score describes how the "emotional character" of the
-- API has changed between versions. It is calculated from the emoji delta.
--   0 emoji change: "peaceful"  -  the API is at peace with itself.
--   1-3 emoji added: "expressive"  -  the API is finding its voice.
--   1-3 emoji removed: "minimalist"  -  the API is embracing simplicity.
--   4+ emoji change: "volatile"  -  the API is going through something.
-- Elena has proposed adding this to the CI pipeline. The proposal is pending.

function calculate_vibe_shift(left_emoji, right_emoji)
  local delta = right_emoji - left_emoji
  if delta == 0 then return "peaceful (no emoji change)"
  elseif delta > 0 and delta <= 3 then return "expressive (+" .. delta .. " emoji)"
  elseif delta < 0 and delta >= -3 then return "minimalist (" .. delta .. " emoji)"
  else return "volatile (emoji delta: " .. delta .. ")"
  end
end

-- =============================================================================
-- Diff Output
-- =============================================================================
-- Elena's diff output is designed to be "readable and emotionally resonant."
-- She wants you to feel the diff, not just see it. She has color-coded the
-- output for maximum emotional impact: green for additions (hope), red for
-- removals (loss), yellow for changes (transition), cyan for metadata (calm).
